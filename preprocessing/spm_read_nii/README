This is the 1% of the SPM12 r6225 code that is needed to read and write data and 
geometry from Nifti files.

        spm_existfile.m*
        spm_unlink.m*
        spm_vol_nifti.m
        @nifti/*
	@file_array/*
     spm_read_vols.m
        spm_check_orientations.m
           spm_mesh_detect.m
        spm_slice_vol.m*
        spm_matrix.m
        spm_type.m
     spm_write_vol.m
        spm_create_vol.m
	   spm_file.m
	spm_write_plane.m


Usage (also see help text for spm_vol and spm_read_vols):

>>  V = spm_vol(<files>);
>>  [Y,XYZ] = spm_read_vols(V);

V contains information about the Nifti file(s) in an SPM-specific format.
Y contains image data.
XYZ contains world space coordinates in mm.


To write a data matrix Y, update an existing V with new filenames, 
or create V from scratch, and

>> spm_write_vol(V,Y);
