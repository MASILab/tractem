We began with a diffusion-weighted image set that had already been adjusted for head motion, eddy current effects, and distortion. For instance, the obtained HCP data sets were preprocessed as described by Glasser et al. (2013).

A T1 anatomical image from the same subject was coregistered to a b=0 image from the diffusion-weighted image set, if necessary (e.g. for BLSA data).

A diffusion tensor reconstruction was performed on the diffusion-weighted image set to produce a fractional anisotropy image in the subject's native space.

The fractional isotropy image was registered to a probabilistic template image using an affine transformation. The template image was generated by applying the "pooled" affine transformation of Lancaster 2007 to the MNI-space fractional anisotropy template image from the FSL atlas distribution [CITE FSL, Mori 2005, Wakana 2007, Hua 2008].

The affine transformation was applied to the diffusion-weighted images, and an appropriate adjustment was made to the b vectors.

A Generalized Q-sampling Imaging (GQI) reconstruction [Yeh 2010], or a 4th order spherical harmonic Q-ball reconstruction (QBI) [Tuch 2004, Descoteaux 2007], was applied to the transformed diffusion-weighted images. GQI works best with a fairly dense sampling of directions and shells (e.g. HCP), whereas QBI is applicable to less densely sampled single-shell data (e.g. BLSA).

To provide the subject-specific lobar masks that are used in some of the tractography protocols, a multi-atlas segmentation algorithm is applied to the subject's native space T1 image [CITE LANDMAN], and this segmentation is transformed to Talairach space using the affine transformation determined above.


Software: Image registrations and transformations were performed using MATLAB [CITE] and SPM 12 [CITE]. Diffusion reconstructions were performed using DSI Studio [CITE].
