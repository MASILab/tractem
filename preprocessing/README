This directory contains code to preprocess diffusion-weighted images ahead of 
the TractEM tracing protocol. For a high level overview, see 
PREPROCESSING_STEPS.txt.


DEPENDENCIES

MATLAB, 2015 or later
https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html

DSI Studio (tested with Jan 19 2018 build on OS X)
https://github.com/frankyeh/DSI-Studio

SPM12 (tested with r6225)
http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/



REQUIRED DATA

Images must be in Nifti format.

- Preprocessed diffusion weighted image series, with associated b value and 
  b vector files

- T1-weighted MRI image

- BrainCOLOR segmentation of the T1-weighted image

- A brain mask image

- Image describing the gradient coil nonlinearities, if available. E.g. 
  "grad_dev" file from HCP datasets.


CODE

atlas
    Creation of a Talairach-space white matter fractional anisotopy atlas to 
	which individual subject's data will be aligned.

example_calling_script_BLSA.m
example_calling_script_HCP.m
    Example matlab scripts to set paths and file locations. Also sets the 
	reconstruction	method, e.g. Q-ball or GQI.

get_BLSA_filenames.m
get_HCP_filenames.m
	Example scripts to find files for a series of subjects and apply 
	study-specific preprocessing (e.g. BLSA data require extra masking and 
	coregistration steps).

process_subject.m
    The main function that processes a subject's data. Aligns the brain to 
	the Talairach space FA template and performs the DSI Studio processing 
	stream to prepare for tractography. Also uses an existing BrainCOLOR 
	segmentation to produce subject-specific region of interest masks for each 
	lobe.

affine_to_tal.m
b_vec_transformation.m
